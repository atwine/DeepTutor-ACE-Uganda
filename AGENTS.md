# DeepTutor — Agent-Native Architecture

## Overview

DeepTutor is an **agent-native** intelligent learning companion organized
around a two-layer plugin model — single-shot **Tools** invoked by the
LLM, and multi-stage **Capabilities** that take over a turn — exposed
through three entry points: CLI, WebSocket API, and Python SDK.

## Architecture

```
Entry Points:  CLI (Typer)  |  WebSocket /api/v1/ws  |  Python SDK
                    ↓                   ↓                   ↓
              ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
              │              ChatOrchestrator                    │
              │   routes UnifiedContext → selected Capability    │
              │   (defaults to `chat`)                           │
              └──────────┬──────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                         │              │
              ┌──────────▼──┐  ┌────────▼──────────┐
              │ ToolRegistry │  │ CapabilityRegistry │
              │  (Level 1)   │  │   (Level 2)        │
              └──────────────┘  └────────────────────┘
```

All capabilities emit on a shared `StreamBus`; the orchestrator fans
events out to consumers. Runtime settings live in
`data/user/settings/*.json` — project-root `.env` files are intentionally
ignored.

### Level 1 — Tools

Single-function tools the LLM picks on demand. Four user-toggleable tools
surface in `/settings/tools`:

| Tool           | Description                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `brainstorm`   | Breadth-first idea exploration with rationale |
| `web_search`   | Web search with citations                     |
| `paper_search` | arXiv preprint search                         |
| `reason`       | Dedicated deep-reasoning LLM call             |

The rest are **context-gated**: the chat capability auto-mounts them from
`ToolMountFlags` (presence of a KB, attachments, sandbox availability, …), and
any of them can also be force-enabled via `--tool`. Auto-mounted set: `rag`,
`read_source`, `read_memory`, `write_memory`, `read_skill`, `load_tools`,
`exec`, `code_execution` (sandboxed Python: NL intent → code → run),
`list_notebook`, `write_note`, `web_fetch`, `github`, `cron`,
`ask_user` (pauses the turn and resumes with the user's reply), plus the
mastery-path tools. `geogebra_analysis` is parked under
`COMING_SOON_TOOL_TYPES`.

### Level 2 — Capabilities

Multi-stage pipelines that own the turn:

| Capability       | Stages                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `chat`           | exploring → responding (single agentic loop, default) |
| `mastery_path`   | responding (Guided Learning — chat loop + mastery tools, gated per topic type) |
| `deep_solve`     | planning → reasoning → writing                        |
| `deep_question`  | ideation → generation                                 |
| `deep_research`  | rephrasing → decomposing → researching → reporting    |
| `visualize`      | analyzing → generating → reviewing (SVG / Chart.js / Mermaid / HTML; or routes to Manim sub-stages via `render_type`) |
| `math_animator`  | concept_analysis → concept_design → code_generation → code_retry → summary → render_output |

All capabilities converge on `emit_capability_result()` in
`deeptutor/capabilities/_shared.py` so every turn emits the same envelope
(response payload + `cost_summary` from `UsageTracker`). Status copy and
prompts are i18n'd via `capabilities/prompts/{en,zh}/<name>.yaml`.

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Install
pip install deeptutor      # Full app (CLI + Web/API + packaged Web assets)
pip install deeptutor-cli  # CLI-only

# Run any capability
deeptutor run chat "Explain Fourier transform"
deeptutor run deep_solve "Solve x^2=4" -t rag --kb my-kb
deeptutor run visualize "Animate sine wave" --config render_mode=manim_video

# Interactive REPL
deeptutor chat
# (inside the REPL: /regenerate or /retry re-runs the last user message)

# Partners (IM-connected companions)
deeptutor partner list

# Knowledge bases, memory, server
deeptutor kb list
deeptutor kb create my-kb --doc textbook.pdf
deeptutor memory show
deeptutor serve --port 8001       # API server only
deeptutor start                   # backend + frontend together
```

## Dependency Layers

Public install paths and source extras are defined in `pyproject.toml`.
Requirements files mirror the same dependency groups for Docker/CI installs.

```
pip install deeptutor      — Full app (CLI + Web/API + packaged Web assets)
pip install deeptutor-cli  — CLI-only (LLM + RAG + providers + document parsing)
pip install -e .           — Source install for development

Source extras (.[ extra ], defined in pyproject.toml):
.[cli]            — CLI-only dependency set
.[server]         — Web/API server dependencies
.[partners]       — Partner channel SDKs + MCP client  (legacy alias: .[tutorbot])
.[matrix]         — Matrix channel for Partners (matrix-nio; needs libolm)
.[matrix-e2e]     — Matrix with end-to-end encryption (matrix-nio[e2e])
.[math-animator]  — Manim addon (powers `visualize` Manim renders + `deeptutor run math_animator`)
.[dev]            — Test / lint tooling
.[all]            — Everything above
```

## Git Branching Workflow

This repo uses a four-stage promotion flow. Work flows strictly one
direction — a feature branch never merges directly into `staging` or
`main`, and `development` never merges directly into `main`.

```
feature/*   →   development   →   staging   →   main
 (many)            (one)            (one)        (one)
```

- **Feature branches** — one per feature/task, often a separate git
  worktree. Fork from the latest `development` (never from `main`
  directly): `git checkout -b feature/<name> development`. Delete after
  merging back into `development`.
- **`development`** — the integration branch. Every feature branch lands
  here first. Direct pushes/merges are allowed (no PR required) — this
  is the fast day-to-day branch.
- **`staging`** — a stabilization checkpoint, promoted from `development`
  once it looks solid (e.g. before a deploy/test pass). Direct
  pushes/merges are allowed (no PR required).
- **`main`** — production. Only ever receives promotions from `staging`.
  **Protected on GitHub: direct pushes are blocked, a pull request is
  required.** No mandatory reviewer (solo maintainer) — the PR step
  itself is what's enforced, not a second approval.

**For agents working in this repo**: when starting new work, branch from
`development`, not `main` (`git checkout -b feature/<name> development`).
Never push directly to `main` — merge into `staging` first, then open a
PR from `staging` into `main`.

## Pre-Commit Review Gate

**Every commit must be reviewed before it's made — no exceptions, including
"trivial" changes.** This was formalized after a session where an ~97-commit,
207-file `staging` branch had accumulated with no consistent review process,
making a proper review nearly impossible without splitting it across many
separate passes.

- **Review the diff you are about to commit, not a batch of unrelated
  changes.** Keep commits small and scoped to one change; a large commit is
  a sign work should have been split, not a review to defer. Batching many
  fixes into one commit specifically to reduce how often you have to review
  is against the spirit of this rule.
- **Depth is proportional to size and risk**, not a fixed ceremony:
  - A one-line config/copy fix: read the diff yourself, confirm it does what
    it says, move on.
  - Anything touching business logic, auth, money/grades, or data
    deletion/migration: re-read the full diff line by line, check every
    caller of anything you changed (not just the lines the diff shows), and
    verify live against the running app — not just "the code looks right."
  - When in doubt, use the `code-review` skill rather than a purely manual
    read.
- **"Tests pass" is not sufficient on its own** for anything touching
  multi-user/course logic — this codebase's real bugs have consistently
  been integration-level, caught by live testing against the running
  Docker stack, not unit tests. If Docker is up, use it.
- **Log what you verified, not just what you changed.** Follow
  `devin-handoff/DEVIN_LOG.md`'s own entry format (Item / Status / What
  changed / **Verified** / New findings / Left for later) — the `Verified`
  line should say *how* you confirmed the change actually works, not just
  restate the diff.
- This applies to every agent working in this repo (Claude, Devin, or
  anyone else) and to every branch, not just `main`-bound work.

## Documentation Conventions

### Python (Google-style docstrings)

All public functions, classes, and methods should have Google-style
docstrings, enforced via Ruff `D` rules (pydocstyle). The convention
is set in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff.lint.pydocstyle]`.

```python
def example(param: str, optional: int = 0) -> bool:
    """Short one-line summary.

    Longer description if needed.

    Args:
        param: Description of the parameter.
        optional: Optional parameter with default.

    Returns:
        Description of return value.

    Raises:
        ValueError: When param is empty.
    """
```

Rules relaxed globally during the documentation migration (issues
#12-#18); per-package enforcement is enabled as each package is
documented.

### TypeScript / React (TSDoc)

Exported functions, classes, and components should have TSDoc
comments, enforced via `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` (warnings during
migration). Format: `/** ... */` with `@param name - description`
(hyphen required).

```typescript
/**
 * Short description.
 *
 * @param name - Description of the parameter.
 * @returns Description of the return value.
 */
export function example(name: string): boolean { ... }
```

Skip: barrel `index.ts`, test files, thin wrappers (<=5 lines),
unexported helpers.
