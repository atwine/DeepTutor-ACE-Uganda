"""Postgres-backed storage for course units, assignments, submissions, and
course-book entries — see devin-handoff/DATABASE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md.

Public surface Tracks 2 and 3 import from:

Nothing else in this codebase should import from this package yet — the
existing JSON-backed `course_units.py`/`assignments.py`/`course_books.py`
stay authoritative until their respective tracks land.
