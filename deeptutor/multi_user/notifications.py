"""Lightweight, polling-based per-course activity feed.

Backed by Postgres via SQLAlchemy async, matching this subsystem's
established pattern (see `course_units.py` / `course_books.py`). A student
sees a notification for every course unit they are *approved*-enrolled in —
the same enrollment check (`is_approved_student_of`) used everywhere else in
this subsystem, imported directly rather than re-derived.

This is deliberately NOT real-time (no websocket push) — the frontend polls
`GET /notifications` on an interval. That's a scoping decision already made,
not something to second-guess here.

All public functions are ``async def`` — callers must ``await`` them.
