"""API for Official Assignments — a persisted, gradable test scoped to a
course unit. Mirrors the access-control pattern in ``router.py``: an
instructor manages only assignments in course units they teach, a student
sees only published assignments in course units they're approved-enrolled
in, and an admin can do anything.
