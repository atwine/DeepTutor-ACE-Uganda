"""Gradebook: aggregates each enrolled student's assignment scores into a
weighted final grade for a course unit — the payoff that replaces manual
Excel-based grade tracking.

Pure aggregation over existing records (course_units.py's roster,
assignments.py's Assignment/Submission) — no storage of its own. A
student's *latest* submission to an assignment is what counts (matches what
the student's own results page already shows them).

NOTE: functions are now ``async def`` because the storage functions they
call (``list_enrollments_for_course``, ``list_assignments_for_course``,
``get_latest_submission``) became async as part of the DB migration.
This is a scope surprise flagged per DATABASE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md §3 —
the logic is identical, only ``await`` was added.
