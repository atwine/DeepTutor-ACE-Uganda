"""Official (graded) assignments — a fixed, persisted question set scoped to a
course unit, with per-student submissions and grading.

Distinct from the ephemeral Quiz/``deep_question`` capability, which
regenerates fresh questions every time and only ever produces conversational
feedback: an Assignment's questions are authored once and then locked on
publish (see :func:`update_assignment`), so a score means the same thing for
every student who takes it, and a ``Submission`` is a permanent, persisted
record rather than a chat-turn artifact.

Storage is now Postgres-backed via SQLAlchemy 2.0 async (see
``deeptutor/services/db/``). Every public function here keeps the same name
and signature it had under the old flat-JSON store so the routers
(``assignments_router.py``) and downstream consumers (``gradebook.py``) only
need to gain ``await`` at call sites, not logic changes — see
``devin-handoff/DATABASE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`` "Decision, post-audit" section.
``grading.py`` imports only the ``QUESTION_TYPES_AUTO_GRADABLE`` constant and
is not affected by the async change.
